costs of ill health. The researchers also found that the UK health service is among the most efficiently run health care systems, for example by spending relatively little budget on administration and keeping medicines costs low.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the UK has below average health spending per person compared to other countries and underperforms significantly on many key health care outcomes, including cancer survival rates and life expectancy.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe report, published ahead of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the NHS, shows that the UK has strikingly low levels of key clinical staff, with fewer doctors and nurses per head than most of its peers, and a heavier reliance on internationally trained staff.

A national focus on training and reform, with some initial financial commitment from government to back the plan, should start to place the NHS workforce on a sustainable footing.\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018The plan comes after years of chronic NHS staff shortages, as well as existing staff being stretched thinly. \u003Ca data-entity-substitution=\u0022canonical\u0022 data-entity-type=\u0022node\u0022 data-entity-uuid=\u0022ef59cfd9-f424-4de8-aa38-82fd9a321b7f\u0022 href=\u0022\/publications\/nhs-compare-health-care-systems-other-countries\u0022 title=\u0022How does the NHS compare to the health care systems of other countries? \u0022\u003EOur analysis shows\u003C\/a\u003E just how deeply a new approach is needed, as we compared the UK to international healthcare systems and found the UK has strikingly low levels of key clinical staff, with fewer doctors and nurses per head than most of its peers.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Of course, the plan needs to be delivered but the commitment to updating the plan every two years provides hope that it will be a lasting way out of the recurrent workforce shortages that have plagued the NHS over decades. The future projections of workforce supply and demand it provides should help politicians and policymakers to lift their heads up from immediate crises and consider the long-term challenges coming down the track.\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018But the projections are likely to be based on ambitious productivity assumptions.

More NHS strikes are planned and the latest staff survey shows work culture, bullying and harassment continue to be a real issue, and nearly 1 in 10 staff experience discrimination. There is much more that can be done to make the NHS an attractive place to work and build a career.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018The expansion of training places comes with some additional funding, but we haven\u2019t yet seen the detail of how this funding will be phased \u2013 and whether it will be sustained \u2013 over many years. Delivery of the wider ambitions of the plan will need sustained investment, and therefore will rest on any future governments throwing their weight behind the strategy, to give the NHS the support and stability it needs.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Once this plan for the NHS has been published, the government should complete its work and create a sister plan for social care, with its own funding and own projections.

National affection for the NHS has at times hindered improvements to health, particularly when important services such as public health and social care have been overlooked as political energy is expended on acute hospital services.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018A greater emphasis on primary and community services has the potential to catch illness earlier and provide patients with more options beyond having to turn up at over-stretched hospitals. This refocusing towards community services has been a political ambition for decades, yet the rhetoric has not translated to reality. Making good on the commitment to bolster community services will mean grappling with knotty issues such as making careers in community services more attractive, improving outdated GP and community health buildings, and shifting the balance of investment away from hospitals toward community services.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Across its conference, Labour has announced some welcome measures including additional funding to help reduce soaring waiting lists. Some hospitals have made progress in addressing the number of people waiting for care by offering planned treatment and outpatient clinics at evenings and weekends and there are merits to Labour\u2019s plan to scale up this approach. Of course, the policy relies on the willingness of staff to work overtime at a point when many health care professionals are demoralised and burnt-out, but the approach has been shown to work and could help to bring down waiting times in the short term.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018While Labour has committed to boost the pay of social care staff, it has yet to set out how it would introduce long overdue reform of the sector. A lack of action by successive governments has led social care services to spiral into crisis.

This refocusing towards community services has been a political ambition for decades, yet the rhetoric has not translated to reality.

Some hospitals have made progress in addressing the number of people waiting for care by offering planned treatment and outpatient clinics at evenings and weekends and there are merits to Labour\u2019s plan to scale up this approach.

saying they often think of leaving. At a time when many people working across NHS are taking the difficult decision to strike over pay, safety and conditions, it is sadly not surprising that this survey paints a picture of staff feeling undervalued, under huge pressure and questioning their roles in the NHS.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Despite government pledges to recruit more staff, the figures show only a quarter of NHS employees feel there are enough staff for them to do their job properly. Additionally, only 63 per cent say that if a friend or relative needed treatment they would be happy with the standard of care provided by the NHS \u2013 a marked decline from 68 per cent last year.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018When it comes to work culture, bullying and harassment among NHS staff continues to be a real issue. Nearly one in five report being bullied by colleagues and nearly one in 10 experience discrimination. And worryingly, 57 per cent of staff have come to work in the past three months despite not feeling well enough to perform their duties.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Today\u2019s figures are a wake-up call to the government of the need for a fully-funded workforce plan that can ensure the right number of staff, with the right skills, working in a supportive culture, so they are able to deliver high quality care to patients.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Bringing down the NHS waiting list is one of the Prime Minister\u2019s five key priorities, but it will not be possible to tackle the growing backlog of care if NHS staff continue to be work in over stretched teams and report that work makes them feel unwell.

For leading killers such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, the UK under-performs along the whole pathway of prevention through to early diagnosis and treatment. Hence the UK\u2019s higher rate of deaths following a heart attack or stroke, poorer cancer survival, and greater rates of avoidable deaths \u2013 all of which contribute to the country\u2019s low ranking on life expectancy.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u2018Pre-pandemic life expectancy in the UK ranked poorly among comparator countries \u2013 with the exception of the US \u2013 particularly among women. As in most countries, mortality in the UK rose sharply in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic; however, the increase was higher in the UK than in many comparator European countries.* Added to which, the burden of long-term and untreated illness in the UK is now burgeoning.
